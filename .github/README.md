# LS Wireless

**LS Wireless** is a research group at UC Irvine focused on signal processing and optimization for next-generation wireless networks.

We develop decentralized algorithms and simulation tools for:
- Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)
- Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)
- Cell-Free Massive MIMO
- Distributed Beamforming and Power Allocation
- AI/ML for Wireless Systems
