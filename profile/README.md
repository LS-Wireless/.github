### 🔬 About Us

**LS Wireless** is a research group at the University of California, Irvine, focusing on signal processing, optimization, and machine learning for next-generation wireless communication systems. Our research is motivated by emerging technologies in:

- Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)
- Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)
- Cell-Free Massive MIMO
- Distributed Optimization and Resource Allocation
- Wireless AI and Learning-based Beamforming

We aim to bridge theory and implementation through analytical modeling, simulation frameworks, and experimental validation.
